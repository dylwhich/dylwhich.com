I am Dylan Whichard. I like Python, Raspberry Pis, cats, Linux, random
gadgets, and home automation. I went to [UMBC](http://umbc.edu) for
Computer Science and now I work at [Koolspan](http://koolspan.com)
doing grown-up professional business code work things. I'm currently
putting most of my coding effort into creating
[idiotic](http://github.com/idiotic), my own home automation platform.
